description: Testpoint.io exists to support the ausdigital.org implementer community.
  Unlike single provider RESTful services(e.g. Google or Facebook APIs), a B2B process
  like e-invoicing needs multiple providers to support the same standard interface
  and to make their services discoverable. As the detailed specifications at ausdigital.org
  describe, there are a number of moving parts. Without a suite of test services and
  test cases, there would be a major risk of incompatible implementations.
