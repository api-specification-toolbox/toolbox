description: <p>The SmartAPI project aims to maximize the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility,
  Interoperability, and Reusability) of web-based Application Programming Interfaces
  (APIs). Rich metadata is essential to properly describe your API so that it becomes
  discoverable, connected, and reusable. We have developed a openAPI-based specification
  for defining the key API metadata elements and value sets. SmartAPI's leverage the
  Open API specification v3 and JSON-LD for providing semantically annotated JSON
  content that can be treated as Linked Data.</p>
