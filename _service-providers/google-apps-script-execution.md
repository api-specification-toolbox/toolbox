description: <p>Runs a function in an Apps Script project. The project must be deployed
  for use with the Apps Script Execution API. This method requires authorization with
  an OAuth 2.0 token that includes at least one of the scopes listed in the Authorization
  section; script projects that do not require authorization cannot be executed through
  this API. To find the correct scopes to include in the authentication token, open
  the project in the script editor, then select File &gt; Project properties and click
  the Scopes tab.</p>
