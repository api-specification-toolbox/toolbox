name: Azure Data Lake Analytics
description: <p>The Data Lake analytics service is a new distributed analytics service
  built on Apache YARN that dynamically scales so you can focus on your business goals,
  not on distributed infrastructure. Instead of deploying, configuring and tuning
  hardware, you write queries to transform your data and extract valuable insights.
  The analytics service can handle jobs of any scale instantly by simply setting the
  dial for how much power you need. You only pay for your job when it is running making
  it cost-effective. The analytics service supports Azure Active Directory letting
  you simply manage access and roles, integrated with your on-premises identity system.
  It also includes U-SQL, a language that unifies the benefits of SQL with the expressive
  power of user code. U-SQL&rsquo;s scalable distributed runtime enables you to efficiently
  analyze data in the store and across SQL Servers in Azure, Azure SQL Database and
  Azure SQL Data Warehouse.</p>
