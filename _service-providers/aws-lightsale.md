description: <p><span>Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS
  for developers who just need virtual private servers. Lightsail includes everything
  you need to launch your project quickly - a virtual machine, SSD-based storage,
  data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP - for a low, predictable price. You
  manage those Lightsail servers through the Lightsail console or by using the API
  or command-line interface (CLI).</span></p>
