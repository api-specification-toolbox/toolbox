description: <p>Design, deploy, and monitor your cloud-native applications, easily.
  Applications running on serverless architectures scale up and down on demand with
  high availability. There is no need to provision or manage servers. Your code runs
  only when it's needed, and you only pay for the compute time you use. Stackery provides
  operational tools for developers building serverless applications. Easily detect
  and surface application errors, version control your serverless infrastructure,
  and securely manage configurations and deployments. Stackery helps developers build
  production-grade serverless applications by providing an abstraction layer on top
  of base serverless technologies like AWS Lambda. Stackery allows you to focus on
  your business logic rather than configuring infrastructure services.</p>
