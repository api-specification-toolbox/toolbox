description: '<p>In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing
  repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the
  easier your job becomes. After you''ve configured it, a task runner can do most
  of that mundane work for you&mdash;and your team&mdash;with basically zero effort.</p>'
