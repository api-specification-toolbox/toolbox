description: |-
  <p>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully managed message queuing service. Amazon SQS makes it simple and cost-effective to decouple the components of a cloud application. You can use Amazon SQS to transmit any volume of data, without losing messages or requiring other services to be always available. Amazon SQS includes&nbsp;<em>standard queues</em>&nbsp;with high throughput and at-least-once processing, and&nbsp;<em>FIFO queues</em>&nbsp;that provide FIFO (first-in, first-out) delivery and exactly-once processing. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>With Amazon SQS, you can offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly available messaging cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use.</p>
