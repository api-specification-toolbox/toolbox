name: AWS X-Ray
description: AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed
  applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray,
  you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing
  to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray
  provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application,
  and shows a map of your applications underlying components. You can use X-Ray to
  analyze both applications in development and in production, from simple three-tier
  applications to complex microservices applications consisting of thousands of services.
