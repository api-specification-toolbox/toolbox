name: AWS Elastic Beanstalk
description: |-
  <p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java,&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/net/">.NET</a>, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/docker/" target="_blank">Docker</a>&nbsp;on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/windows/">IIS</a>.</p>
  <p>You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.</p>
  <p>There is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk - you pay only for the AWS resources needed to store and run your applications.</p>
