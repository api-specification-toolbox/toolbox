description: <p>Apigee Edge is a platform for developing and managing API proxies.
  Think of a proxy as an abstraction layer that "fronts" for your backend service
  APIs and provides value-added features like security, rate limiting, quotas, analytics,
  and more. The primary consumers of Edge API proxies are app developers who want
  to use your backend services.</p>
