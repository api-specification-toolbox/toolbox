name: Web Concepts
description: <p>The Web's Uniform Interface is based on a large and growing set of
  specifications. These specifications establish the shared concepts that providers
  and consumers of Web services can rely on. Web Concepts is providing an overview
  of these concepts and of the specifications defining them. One example for how this
  works is the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which defines the media type text/html
  and a set of link relation types such as alternate and section. Web Concepts provides
  a structured, quick, and interlinked overview of these and many more concepts that
  together establish the Web surface.</p>
