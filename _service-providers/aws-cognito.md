name: AWS Cognito
description: <p>Amazon Cognito lets you easily add user sign-up and sign-in to your
  mobile and web apps. With Amazon Cognito, you also have the options to authenticate
  users through social identity providers such as Facebook, Twitter, or Amazon, with
  SAML identity solutions, or by using your own identity system. In addition, Amazon
  Cognito enables you to save data locally on users devices, allowing your applications
  to work even when the devices are offline. You can then synchronize data across
  users devices so that their app experience remains consistent regardless of the
  device they use. With Amazon Cognito, you can focus on creating great app experiences
  instead of worrying about building, securing, and scaling a solution to handle user
  management, authentication, and sync across devices.</p>
