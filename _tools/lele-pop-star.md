description: "In my 54 years I have listened to all kinds of music from A to Z. I
  have always loved music. I know that if you are reading this you, too, are a music
  lover. Music is sublime, mechanical, and mathematical in its complexity. Those who
  can write music and perform what they write are truly talented individuals. They
  see ideas in their minds and turn them into sound for the rest of us to enjoy. Le
  Le is one of those glorious individuals who can do just that. Le Le is a pop artist.
  Her music is, of course, danceable but it also has a message. \u201CMoney Whore\u201D
  is about the dog eat dog world we live in and the people who prostitute their morality
  and replace it with the desire for money, money, money. It is a shame there are
  so many rip off artists in the music industry who go with this philosophy and use
  the excuse, \u201C That is just the way it is, we have to make that money and getting
  ripped off is just part of the business for you newcomers. In spite of these rip
  off artists in the music industry, Le Le is overcoming these obstacles. Her latest
  Video,\u201D Power\u201D, is about overcoming the negative and turning that negative
  into a positive by exercising your personal power and never giving up until you
  win the game we all have to play in life. These are just two examples of Le le\u2019s,
  Amanda McCauley by birth, philosophical outlook on life and how we should all conduct
  ourselves in life. Be kind and fair to everyone and beware of the crooks because
  they are out there. Amanda writes from her heart and is quickly gaining popularity
  in the Detroit Music Scene. She has also performed in LA and Texas. Her show the
  other night was amazing. Her voice is powerful and the messages resonate with young
  people of all races and creeds because they are universal. Many young people, certainly
  those struggling with life appreciate her experiences and identify with the feelings
  expressed. Le Le is very much loved by everyone she works with. Her style and swagger
  are indicative of her desire to make it in a world dominated by excess and greed;
  conspicuous consumption and the need to keep up with the Joneses even to personal
  ruin. We all want the things we THINK we can\u2019t have so we take shortcuts to
  our own detriment. Le Le, through her music and message, tells us we can have those
  things but we need to work at it and watch after ourselves because no one else will.
  Watch out for this young lady from Detroit, Michigan. The name is Le Le and she
  will be a household name before too long and will bring you as much joy as she brings
  me.  By, Michael Wallick http://www.MichaelsMusicBlog.com http://www.LeLeOfficial.com"
