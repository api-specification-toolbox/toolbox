description: Welcome to "MERN Stack Front To Back". In this course we will build an
  in depth full stack social network application using Node.js, Express, React, Redux
  and MongoDB along with ES6+. We will start with a bank text editor and end with
  a deployed full stack application. This course includes...  Building an extensive
  backend API with Node.js & Express Protecting routes/endpoints with JWT (JSON Web
  Tokens) Extensive API testing with Postman Integrating React with our backend in
  an elegant way, creating a great workflow Building our frontend to work with the
  API Using Redux for app state management Creating reducers and actions for our resources
  Creating many container components that integrate with Redux Testing with the Redux
  Chrome extension Creating a build script, securing our keys and deploy to Heroku
  using Git This is NOT an "Intro to React" or "Intro to Node" course. It is a practical
  hands on course for building an app using the incredible MERN stack. I do try and
  explain everything as I go so it is possible to follow without React/Node experience
  but it is recommended that you know at least the basics first.
