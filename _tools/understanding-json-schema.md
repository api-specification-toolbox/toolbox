name: Understanding JSON Schema
slug: understanding-json-schema
description: JSON Schema is a powerful tool for validating the structure of JSON data. However, learning to use it by reading its specification is like learning to drive a car by looking at its blueprints. You don’t need to know how an electric motor fits together if all you want to do is pick up the groceries. This book, therefore, aims to be the friendly driving instructor for JSON Schema. It’s for those that want to write it and understand it, but maybe aren’t interested in building their own car—er, writing their own JSON Schema validator—just yet.
