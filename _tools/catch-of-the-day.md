description: "React For Beginners \u2014 ReactForBeginners.com Starter files for the
  React For Beginners course. Come Learn React with me!  The code in this repo meant
  to be a reference point for anyone following along with the video course.  To Start
  Note - one of the dependencies is currently not working with Node.js 10.3, please
  use version 9.11.1 (or around that, 8.x and 9.x should work fine) until then.  cd
  into catch-of-the-day and follow along with the videos  Each numbered folder in
  stepped-solutions contains the files for the beginning of each correspondingly numbered
  video, should you need them. So, if you need any code, pull the appropriate file
  into your catch-of-the-day folder.  You are welcome to submit Pull Requests but
  I'd like to keep the code as similar as possible to the course content.  Code Use
  You are welcome to use this code in your own applications. If you would like to
  use it for training purposes, please shoot me a message first to make sure it's
  okay.  Frequently Asked Questions \u2753 I'm getting error \"Pre-built binaries
  not found for grpc@1.10.1 and node@10.3.0\" and \"Tried to download(403): https://storage.googleapis.com.....\"
  One of the dependencies is currently not working with Node.js 10.3, please use version
  9.11.1 (or around that, 8.x and 9.x should work fine) until then. Don't sweat this
  as it's just build tooling and isn't related to the version of react you are using.
  \ \u2753 I tried installing the Babel syntax highlighter but it didn't work! There
  are a few possible options:  If you are on Sublime Text 2, you should Upgrade to
  Sublime Text 3. Some users have reported restarting works You can try the JavaScript
  Next syntax highlighter instead \u2753 I can't set Babel as the default syntax highlighter!
  Make sure you are in a file with the extension of .js before you do this step -
  you can't set the default for a file without having a file open!  \u2753 I can't
  see the React tab in my dev tools Restart your dev tools or your chrome browser
  entirely. They will only show up when you are viewing a React app - so make sure
  you test it on Facebook or another website that is running React. It won't work
  on your empty main.js file until you import React from 'react'.  \u2753 npm start
  doesn't update the app on file save, or doesn't run correctly. There may be a few
  different causes for this:  Webpack currently can't handle folder/file names that
  contain parentheses. Webpack also has problems running inside folders for Dropbox/Google
  Drive type services. Git is recommended for keeping your files in sync across multiple
  computers. Changes In the 2018 RE-Record In March 2018 I re-recorded this course.
  Here are the things that I've updated.  Upgrade to React Router 4 Final API Use
  React 16.3 Move to external PropTypes Package Use React's new Refs API, remove function
  refs Remove all use of constructors and super() - use class properties instead Better
  explain binding, use of this and component instances Moved from React-addons-css-transition-group
  to react-transition-group and upgraded from 1.x to 2.x Use official Firebase package
  for Auth as re-base is now only for data binding Move promise based code to async/await
  Show how to return multiple elements with React.Fragment htaccess Here is the .htaccess
  file we use in the apache deployment video  RewriteBase / RewriteRule ^index\\.html$
  - [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule
  . /index.html [L]"
