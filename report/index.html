<p><strong>Help</strong> us at <strong>API Specification Toolbox</strong> curate and tag content featuring OpenAPI, JSON Schema, AsyncAPI, GraphQL and gRPC and <strong>we&#39;ll promote your Twitter account</strong> in our weekly newsletter.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The API Specification Weekly Report is a project that seeks to track 5 specifications and their ecosystems. We are focused on <strong>OpenAPI, JSON Schema, AsyncAPI, GraphQL and gRPC</strong>. And we collect content from the following categories on each of the 5 specifications.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>People</strong> (those who are prominent in producing content, contributing to specs, building tools or implementing the specs.)</li>
<li><strong>Adoption</strong> (companies, technologies or tools that adoption a spec)</li>
<li><strong>Issues</strong> (selected from the Github repos of the specs)</li>
<li><strong>Discussions</strong> (selected from the Github repos of the specs)</li>
<li><strong>News</strong> (curated from Hacker News, newsletters, funding announcements, or blogs)</li>
<li><strong>Tweets</strong> (Twitter of course :)</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong> (YouTube or anywhere else)</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong></li>
<li><strong>Events</strong> (upcoming conferences, meetups, or webinars related to a spec)</li>
<li><strong>NewFunding</strong> (new funding announcements that involve adoption of the specs or its tools)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the categories we&#39;ve been tracking for the past few months and give a broad view of current and important developments across the ecosystems of these five specifications.</p>
<p>Now we would like to open up this process to the wider community so that we all can highlight the important content for each of OpenAPI, JSON Schema, AsyncAPI, GraphQL and gRPC. Afterall, a thought eyes are better than two when capturing notable occurances from a fairly broad corner of the tech space.</p>
<p>This document will help you with the low friction, easy process of adding your thoughts or choices to a valuable resource for the API sector.</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-participate">Steps to Participate</h2>
<ul>
<li>Step 1. Follow our <a href="https://twitter.com/APISpecToolbox">API Specification Toolbox account</a> on Twitter.</li>
<li>Step 2. Read some of the tweets to get a feel for what we tweet and how we use hashtags # to associate a piece of content with a spec or specs and the categories.</li>
<li>Step 3. @ mention the <a href="https://twitter.com/APISpecToolbox">API Specification Toolbox account</a> when you tweet content to add to the weekly report.</li>
<li>Step 4. When you add the hashtags to help us categorize the content we will feature your Twitter account in our newsletter.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s it. It&#39;s simple and will become second nature to your tweet process once you&#39;ve posted a few @ mentions.</p>
<p>NOTE: Some content will be suitable for multiple specs and more frequently multiple categories. Just be sure to add a hashtag for each spec or category tag you want to use.</p>
