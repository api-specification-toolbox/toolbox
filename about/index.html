                        <p>This is a project to help map out the API specificaton landscape, and drive more awareness around how specifications can be used. The project is being established and grown by Postman and API Evangelist, but is intendeded to be a community project that any API provider, service provider, tooling owner, or developer can use to understand what is happening when it comes to how API specifications are being used. This entire project runs on Github to drive community participation, while keeping everything as observable as possible.</p>
												<p>This API Specification Toolbox is the result of several months of discussion arouind what is needed to drive more discussion around API specifications, running 100% on GitHub. If there is a specification, news story, service, tooling, exestion, video, or blog post you'd like to see here, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/toolbox">submit a pull request on the Github repository behind this site</a>. If you aren't comfortable submitting a PR, feel free to also <a href="https://github.com/api-specification-toolbox/toolbox/issues">submit a Github issue with any feedback</a> about the project or anything published here. We look forward to working with you helping define the API specification landscape.</p>
